# Music-Visualizer-QM-Paper

Music visualisation is the electronic generation of objects based on music. The
visualisation adds new depth to the music by allowing you to “see” what is being played.
Visualisation has been delved into thoroughly in the two-dimensional space that is the
traditional desktop environment. Windows media player has a selection of appealing
visualisations that have a pure entertainment value. This led me wondering about threedimensional representations of music. Virtual reality is a medium that allows the user to
engross themselves in a 3D world like the real world.

The goal was to acquire the skills to create a music visualizer with a user interface, in
virtual reality, that boasts a high entertainment value. The project started off as a hobby
project with personal goals that transformed into something more. The project is created
in Unity for the Oculus Rift. The application fulfils the main goal. It provides the user with
a functional music visualiser with a user interface in virtual space that can control music
selection and visualize audio information from different sources.

The motivation behind this project stems from poor quality, free-to-acquire, visualizers
not living up to the brief that this project is trying to achieve. Learning from the mistakes
of these applications provides the project with insight on what to avoid. Furthermore, the
project targets dedicated music listeners that want a seated experience.

The application runs on Windows for the Oculus. The project has concluded one
development cycle and has provided me with research to further improve the
visualisation concept. Testing concluded that psychedelic visualizations that aid a
hallucinogenic experience should be a primary focus of virtual reality music visualizers.
